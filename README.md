ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Carlotta Zanotto, an ITS student with a passion for full-stack web development. I hold a diploma in Business Information Systems from a technical institute specializing in Economic and IT studies, and Iâ€™m currently focusing on mastering web development.

On my GitHub, youâ€™ll find various projects Iâ€™ve worked on throughout my studies, mainly focusing on Front-End development. I enjoy working with Angular, HTML, CSS, and I also have a passion for Web Design, using tools like Figma and Sketch.

Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges to improve my skills and grow as a developer. ðŸš€
